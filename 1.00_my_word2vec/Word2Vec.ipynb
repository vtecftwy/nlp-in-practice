    "# Getting started with Word2Vec in Gensim and making it work!\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Word2Vec is pretty simple. We are making and assumption that you can tell the meaning of a word by the company it keeps. This is analogous to the saying *show me your friends, and I'll tell who you are*. So if you have two words that have very similar neighbors (i.e. the usage context is about the same), then these words are probably quite similar in meaning or are at least highly related. For example, the words `shocked`,`appalled` and `astonished` are typically used in a similar context. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Gensim implementation of Word2Vec and actually get it to work! I have heard a lot of complaints about poor performance etc, but its really a combination of two things, (1) your input data and (2) your parameter settings. Note that the training algorithms in this package were ported from the [original Word2Vec implementation by Google](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) and extended with additional functionality."

    "Next, is our dataset. The secret to getting Word2Vec really working for you is to have lots and lots of text data. In this case I am going to use data from the [OpinRank](http://kavita-ganesan.com/entity-ranking-data/) dataset. This dataset has full user reviews of cars and hotels. I have specifically concatenated all of the hotel reviews into one big file which is about 97MB compressed and 229MB uncompressed. We will use the compressed file for this tutorial. Each line in this file represents a hotel review. You can download the OpinRank Word2Vec dataset here.\n",

    "To avoid confusion, while gensimâ€™s word2vec tutorial says that you need to pass it a sequence of sentences as its input, you can always pass it a whole review as a sentence (i.e. a much larger size of text), and it should not make much of a difference. \n",

      "b\"Oct 12 2009 \\tNice trendy hotel location not too bad.\\tI stayed in this hotel for one night. As this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. Once I have eventually arrived at the hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. It was very stylish and modern. I found the reception's staff geeting me with 'Aloha' a bit out of place, but I guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.As I have a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I was given a small gift upon-check in. It was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.My room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.The location is not great. It is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in Beijing, then you will be ok.I chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. There are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. There is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if I did not plan to travel to central Beijing, as it can take a long time. The location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat!\\t\\r\\n\"\n"

    "## Understanding some of the parameters\n",
    "To train the model earlier, we had to set some parameters. Now, let's try to understand what some of them mean. For reference, this is the command that we used to train the model.\n",

    "### `size`\n",
    "The size of the dense vector to represent each token or word. If you have very limited data, then size should be a much smaller value. If you have lots of data, its good to experiment with various sizes. A value of 100-150 has worked well for me. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `window`\n",
    "The maximum distance between the target word and its neighboring word. If your neighbor's position is greater than the maximum window width to the left and the right, then, some neighbors are not considered as being related to the target word. In theory, a smaller window should give you terms that are more related. If you have lots of data, then the window size should not matter too much, as long as its a decent sized window. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `min_count`\n",
    "Minimium frequency count of words. The model would ignore words that do not statisfy the `min_count`. Extremely infrequent words are usually unimportant, so its best to get rid of those. Unless your dataset is really tiny, this does not really affect the model.\n",

    "## When should you use Word2Vec?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many application scenarios for Word2Vec. Imagine if you need to build a sentiment lexicon. Training a Word2Vec model on large amounts of user reviews helps you achieve that. You have a lexicon for not just sentiment, but for most words in the vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond, raw unstructured text data, you could also use Word2Vec for more structured data. For example, if you had tags for a million stackoverflow questions and answers, you could find tags that are related to a given tag and recommend the related ones for exploration. You can do this by treating each set of co-occuring tags as a \"sentence\" and train a Word2Vec model on this data. Granted, you still need a large number of examples to make it work. \n"
